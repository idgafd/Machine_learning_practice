# Machine_learning_practice

This repository contains educational projects related to machine learning and neural networks. It is divided into two main sections:

## 1. Simple Models

The `simple-models` directory includes various implementations of classical machine learning models for regression and classification using Scikit-Learn. These models serve as fundamental building blocks for understanding machine learning concepts.

## 2. Models of Neural Networks

The `models-of-neural-networks` directory is focused on neural networks and various algorithms for training and formatting them using TensorFlow. This section delves into the realm of deep learning and covers a wide range of neural network architectures and techniques.
